Trying to statistically interpolate drillhole data to find predict the shape of mining deposits

This is a very messy repository because much of this stuff is coming from my experiments on colab notebooks

Next steps:

1. experiment with model architectures, though i don't have much hope for this
2. figure out some normalization scheme for datasets, because the data i am currently is very far off from normally distributed
3. make sure the model doesn't learn a flat function because of bullet point 2
